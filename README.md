Currently, there's only one component that does
one simple but very helpful thing: replace the
1pp Cloudkill graphics with the vanilla BG2 one.

You may ask why, so, well, let me tell you.

First, it's hard to see what's going on in the
portion of the screen with the cloud on it with
the 1pp graphics. This does not happen with the
vanilla BG2 one.

Second, the 1pp graphics sometimes slow down the
game. If you spam enough Cloudkills, the BG2 one
will do the same, but generally you need over
twenty, not just five.
